# Librem 5 accessibility

Librem 5 is a smartphone running free software by design. It is produced and supported by [Purism](https://puri.sm).

This repository will contain configuration files and scripts for use with a [PureOS](https://pureos.net/) system on a Librem 5 phone. [The project Wiki](https://github.com/Merivuokko/librem5-accessibility/wiki) contains instructions on how to set up the phone to be accessible and how to use it with low vision or entirely without sight.
